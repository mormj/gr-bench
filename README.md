Tools for comparative benchmarking of GNU Radio flowgraphs

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide comparative benchmarking tools for arbitrary GNU Radio flowgraphs, so that changes to the hardware, accelerated blocks, scheduler can be analyzed as variables are changed.  

There have been several projects focused on gathering benchmarking info from running GNU Radio flowgraphs.
